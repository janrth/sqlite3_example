I show a quick example on how to use sqlite3. I use an instance to have two different ways to create a sqlite3 database from a file. 
On rather manual way, which might work if you do not have so many columns. And a second, which works even if you have multiple columns. 
Here I show an example having 50 columns. 

After creating and inserting, I query these databases in pandas. 

That`s all...
